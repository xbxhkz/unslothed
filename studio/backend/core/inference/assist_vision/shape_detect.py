"""Shape detection via a locally-run torchvision Mask R-CNN pipeline
(labeled, per-instance segmentation -- masks, not just boxes). Chosen over
this package's own ``yolo.py`` (ultralytics) pipeline specifically because
ultralytics is AGPL-3.0-licensed with a field-of-use-restricted weights
distribution, while torchvision is BSD-3-Clause with no such restriction on
its pretrained weights -- so this needs no license-acceptance gate, just a
plain download-if-missing step. Masks are produced (and returned in each
detection) even though this module's own callers currently only report
labels/boxes/positions in text -- a future shape-swap capability needs real
per-instance masks for a clean cutout, and building the right pipeline once
now avoids redoing this work later.

API verified directly against the installed torchvision package
(site-packages, not web search / training-data memory) before writing this
module:
  - maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn(weights=MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.DEFAULT,
    weights_backbone=None) -- passing weights= makes the function skip the
    separate ImageNet backbone download entirely (confirmed via source:
    `if weights is not None: weights_backbone = None`), so only ONE download
    happens (the full COCO-pretrained state dict).
  - Inference (eval mode, no_grad) on a list of one [C,H,W] float tensor in
    0-1 range (via torchvision.transforms.functional.to_tensor) returns a
    list of one dict: {"boxes": FloatTensor[N,4], "labels": Int64Tensor[N],
    "scores": FloatTensor[N], "masks": FloatTensor[N,1,H,W] in 0-1 range,
    threshold at 0.5 per torchvision's own docs}. Masks come back at the
    SAME (H, W) as the input tensor -- no resizing needed.
  - MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.DEFAULT.meta["categories"] is a 91-entry
    COCO category list (index 0 is "__background__"; a few interior indices
    are the literal string "N/A", COCO's original non-contiguous numbering)
    -- readable without triggering any download, since it's plain Enum
    metadata, not part of the state dict fetch.
  - The weights download (torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url under the
    hood) is cached under torch.hub.get_dir() -- explicitly redirected to
    the model cache dir via torch.hub.set_dir() before model construction,
    mirroring this package's own model-caching convention rather than
    leaving it to scatter into the user's global ~/.cache/torch.
